[Why Reflect?](https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/why-reflect)

Reflecting on experience is part of how we learn.
It is suggested in this article that without a reflecion upon our experiences we can achieve at best surface level understanding.
For deep understanding we need to reflect on our concrete experiences.
Reflection can take a number of forms. It could simply be internally reflecting on an experience or could for example, take the form of storytelling.

The contents of this article ring true with my own experience, and a lot of my other recent reading. In Mind for Numbers Barbara Oakley stresses that we must leave ourselves adequate time to learn a new skill.
She states that attempting to cram learning into a short time period means that we lose the cycle of hard work and subsequent reflection that lead to the formation of true understanding.

I have made this repository specifically to try and force myself to a) reflect on what I read and b) write down these reflections in a place I can refer back to them in future.
